# rsh

[![CI](https://github.com/ferris007/rsh/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ferris007/rsh/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A Unix shell built from first principles in Rust — exploring processes, file
descriptors, pipelines, signals, job control, terminals, and event-driven
systems.

`rsh` is not a Bash replacement. It is a systems-engineering project: an
experimental shell whose purpose is to make the operating system's process
model visible instead of hiding it. Every feature is implemented on top of
primitives that were understood first.

The goal is a shell **small enough to understand and deep enough to expose how
Unix actually works**.

## Status

Phase 1 — an interactive shell that runs commands. It resolves programs through
`PATH`, forks and executes them, reports exit status the way POSIX shells do,
and implements `cd` and `exit` as builtins.

```console
$ cargo run -p rsh
rsh> echo hello
hello
rsh> cd /usr
rsh> pwd
/usr
rsh> nope
rsh: nope: command not found
rsh> echo hi | grep hi
rsh: `|` is not supported yet (roadmap phase 4)
  echo hi | grep hi
          ^
rsh> exit
```

Pipelines, redirection, expansion, signals, and job control are not implemented
yet. Operators for them are recognised and refused with the phase that will
deliver them, rather than passed through as ordinary arguments — a shell that
quietly handed `>` to `echo` would be lying about what it does.

See [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) for the full plan and what lands when.

## Principles

- **Systems first** — understand OS primitives instead of hiding them behind
  abstractions.
- **Safe by default** — lean on Rust's type system; isolate `unsafe` to the
  handful of places where the *semantics* are genuinely unsafe.
- **Observable** — process, pipeline, signal, and performance behaviour is
  exposed through tests and diagnostics, not asserted in prose.
- **Incremental complexity** — every feature builds on a previously understood
  primitive.
- **Portable where practical** — Unix-like systems, with Linux as the primary
  development platform.
- **Performance-aware** — measure before optimizing.

## Building

```console
$ cargo build
$ cargo test
$ cargo run -p rsh
```

Requires Rust 1.85 or newer (see `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`).

## Repository layout

```text
crates/rsh            the REPL: read a line, dispatch it, loop
crates/rsh-parser     text → AST; never touches the operating system
crates/rsh-executor   builtins, dispatch, shell state
crates/rsh-process    fork / exec / wait, PATH resolution — all the `unsafe`
docs/                 architecture and systems notes
experiments/          standalone programs, each answering one systems question
```

The split is not decoration. `rsh-parser` produces structure from a string and
can be tested exhaustively without spawning anything; `rsh-process` holds every
`unsafe` block that touches the process table, so the argument for the
fork/exec window fits in one file. See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md).

`experiments/` is a deliberate part of the project rather than a scratch
directory: each entry poses a single concrete question about Unix behaviour,
answers it with a runnable program, and records the observation. The notes are
part of the deliverable.
